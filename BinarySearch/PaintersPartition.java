//Given 2 integers A and B and an array of integers C of size N. Element C[i] represents the length of ith board.
//        You have to paint all N boards [C0, C1, C2, C3 … CN-1].
//        There are A painters available and each of them takes B units of time to paint 1 unit of the board.
//
//        Calculate and return the minimum time required to paint all boards under the constraints that
//        any painter will only paint contiguous sections of the board.
//        NOTE:
//        1. 2 painters cannot share a board to paint. That is to say, a board cannot be painted partially by one painter, and partially by another.
//        2. A painter will only paint contiguous boards. This means a configuration where painter 1 paints boards 1 and 3 but not 2 is invalid.
//
//        Return the ans % 10000003

// Input1          Input2
//A = 2             A = 10
//B = 5             B = 1
//C = [1, 10]       C = [1, 8, 11, 3]
