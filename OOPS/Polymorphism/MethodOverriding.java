/*
 * ðŸ”¹ Definition of Method Overriding:
 * Method Overriding in Java occurs when a subclass provides its own implementation of a method
 * that is already defined in its parent (superclass).
 *
 * âœ… Rules of Overriding:
 * 1. Method name must be the same.
 * 2. Parameter list must be the same.
 * 3. Return type must be the same (or covariant).
 * 4. It happens in an inheritance relationship (child class extends parent).
 *
 * ðŸ‘‰ It is an example of Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic Polymorphism), because
 *    the method that gets executed is decided at runtime based on the object type.
